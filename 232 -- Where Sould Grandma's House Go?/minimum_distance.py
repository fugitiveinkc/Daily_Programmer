Title: Where Should Grandma's House Go?

Objective: Given a set of N cartesian coordinates, find the two points with the least distance between them.

Current thoughts:
	-Avoid saving the distances into memory.
	-Perhaps it's easier just to save the current distance and change it based on if another distance exceeds it.

#Function that finds minimum distance between two points and tells you the distance and the points. Feel like recursion?
